# Working with React Components

## About

This project is a practicum of development of React (v18) components. It may grow over time, but its original scope is limited.

## Available Scripts

While in the project directory, you can run the following commands from your terminal:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Your default browser should automatically open a tab to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

For more information, read about: [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder and optimizes it for performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

The app is then ready to be deployed. (See the section below about deployment.)

### `npm run eject`
:warning: **Warning: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we (Facebook) understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
